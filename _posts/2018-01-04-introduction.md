# Welcome

Welcome to my personal blog and wiki.  My primary intent for this site is to document my research into science, religion, and life.  After being raised as a christian, then becoming an atheist, I would like to revisit some of my past thought processes and rationale for becoming an atheist, explore additional information sources on both sides of the issue, and systematically record the results.

I am currently the Manager for [Software Systems Development and Research](https://www.lib.umd.edu/dss/software) at the [University of Maryland Libraries](https://www.lib.umd.edu/).  I have worked there for 25 years building information systems in support of the teaching, learning, and research missions of the university.  I love this work and feel that in supporting the mission of the university I am contributing to society and to the benefit of all people.  Despite having worked at a major research institution I have not participated much in research myself.  This project will allow me to learn and apply good research techniques and also improve my writing skills.

# Technologies

I'm unable to create content without being at least as interested in the technologies used to build and disseminate that content.  I'll be making use of open technologies as much as possible and hope to learn and experiment with these as well.

[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. I will also be taking advantage of the many Jekyll plugins, including [Jekyll Scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar).

[Neocities](https://neocities.org) is a social network of web sites that offer free static web hosting and tools that allow you to create your own web site.  They also support [IPFS](https://neocities.org/permanent-web).

[IPFS](https://ipfs.io) is the Distributed Web, a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol
to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
