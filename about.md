# Personal

My personal blog and wiki.  My initial intent for this site is to document my research into science, religion, and life.  After being raised as a Christian, then becoming an Atheist, I would like to revisit some of my past thinking, explore new information, and systematically record the results.

# Professional

I am the Manager for Software Systems Development and Research at the University of Maryland Libraries.
