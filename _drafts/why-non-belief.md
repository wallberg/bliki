If I was raised a Christian, why did I un-believe? The most succint answer is that over time I learned more about the world through personal observation, general education, and science reading, and I came to these realizations:

1. I see no evidence of supernatural processes in the world
2. I see plenty of evidence of natural processes in the world, including those claimed to be supernatural

By [supernatural](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/supernatural) processes I mean anything outside the natural world and therefore not subject to the rules of natural world.  Many people associate "supernatural" with witches, ghosts, poltergeists, etc but exclude their own religious beliefs. In other words anything they believe to be real is not "supernatural" but anything they don't believe to be real is.  I include everything not governed by the rules of the natural world, that is "above" or "outside" the laws of nature.

What are some of these supernatural processes for which I see no evidence?  To name a few: miracles, divine inspiration of religious writings, and in general any divine intervention in human affairs.

On the other hand the more we learn about the natural world, including development of life this planet, the more appears to be driven through natural processes.

So why do so many people have religious belief? In summary, because we have good imaginations, it was the original science, original law enforcement, it alleviates many of our built-in fears, and due to the methods of propogation from one generation to the next.

I don't believe we can either prove or disprove God or anything supernatural. All we can do is make rational decisions based on the preponderance of evidence. My take is that we live in a natural world which follows natural laws, or rules.  If anything exists outside this natural world which doesn't follow those rules, there is no way to know that unless the supernatural entity were to intervene in this world and provide some evidence.  But, I see no evidence of that happening therefore I have no reason to believe in the entity itself.

However, I'm always open to reevaluate my position given new evidence.  So does that make me an atheist or agnostic?  Getting a label isn't that important to me so let's save that for a potential future post.
