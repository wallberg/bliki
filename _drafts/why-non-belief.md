If I was raised a Christian, why did I un-believe? The most succint answer is that over time I learned more about the world through personal observation, general education, and science reading, and I came to these realizations:

1. I saw no evidence of supernatural processes in the world
2. I saw plenty of evidence of natural processes in the world, including those claimed to be supernatural

By supernatural processes I mean anything outside the natural world and therefore not subject to the rules of natural world.  Many people associate "supernatural" with witches, ghosts, poltergeists, etc but exclude their own religious beliefs. In other words anything they believe to be real is not "supernatural" but anything they don't believe to be real is.  I include everything not governed by the rules of the natural world, that is "above" or "outside" the laws of nature. I confess that's easy for me to do because I don't believe any of it is real.

What are some of these supernatural processes for which I see no evidence?  To name a few miracles and other forms of divine intervention
- miracles
- visitations
- origin of the Bible
- evolution and natural selection

Why do people believe?
fear of being cast out (family, church, tribe)
fear of death
fear of pain
fear of not being in control
fear of not knowing

My take is that we live in a natural world which follows natural laws, or rules.  If anything exists outside this natural world which doesn't follow those rules, there is no way to know that unless the supernatural entity were to intervene in this world and provide some evidence.  But, I see no evidence of that happening therefore I have no reason to believe in the entity itself.  However, I'm always open to reevaluate my position given new evidence.  So does that make me an atheist or agnostic?  Getting a label isn't that important to me so let's save that for a potential future post.
