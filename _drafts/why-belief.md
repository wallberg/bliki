First, the home sapien brain has an amazing capacity for making models of the world through symbolic processing. Those models help us predice the future, fill in our gaps in knowledge, communicate via language, and have "imagincations". In other words, our brain can create things that aren't real in our heads.

Why do people believe?
fear of being cast out (family, church, tribe)
fear of death
fear of pain
fear of not being in control
fear of not knowing
