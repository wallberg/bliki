Why do the first three require proof while the fourth only need to show possibility?

Isn't proof a much higher burden than he applies to his own faith?

> *Neo-Darwinism* isn't a scientific theory, either! Darwinism can't be tested in the lab. It can't be proven with mathematical models. Here's why. Darwinism claims that random mutation combined with natural selection over time causes evolution. However, *the claim that any mutation is random is not provable*. {%cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock205 -l 73 %}
