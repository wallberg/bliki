In this post I review Evolution 2.0: Breaking the Deadlock Between Darwin and Design {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 %} The author, Perry Marshall, presents a view of evolution as a middle ground between the dogmatic views of many advocates of two sides. Advocates for Intelligent Design need to accept that evolution is real, advocates for Neo-Darwinism need to accept that evolution is not random or designless. My intent here is not to present a comprehensive treatment of the book but rather a summary of the major takeaways for me personally.

who is the author

author:

- Evolution is a documented, scientifically based reality

- Theists and scientists should both be interested in science based exploration of the natural world

- Proponents of Creationism/Intelligent Design are wrong to deny evolution

- Proponents of Random Mutation (Neo-Darwinists) are wrong to deny designed, goal-driven evolution

- DNA is code (meets the requirements of code, encoder, and decoder)

- Darwinism is Random Mutation + Natural Selection + Time = Evolution

- In reality, Adaptive Variation + Natural Selection + Time = Evolution 2.0

## Evolution is not Random

I feel the strongest argument the author makes in this book is for the reality of evolution based on several hundred years of scientific investigation, but coupled with a bizarre fixation on randomness as the key component driving evolution, when in fact we see that

For me, the most eye-opening revelation in this book is the extent to which

Though obsesively focused on 

## Evolution is driven by Design

## Conclusions

The author has a strong bias towards justifying his theism

Many atheists (and educators?) have a strong bias towards justifying their beliefs and therefore firmly hold to the obsolete theory of evolution which hold that all change occurs by undirected "random" changes in the genetic code.
