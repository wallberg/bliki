In this post I review Evolution 2.0: Breaking the Deadlock Between Darwin and Design {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 %} The author, Perry Marshall, presents a view of evolution as a middle ground between the dogmatic views of many advocates of two sides. Advocates for Intelligent Design need to accept that evolution is real, advocates for Neo-Darwinism need to accept that evolution is not random or designless. My intent here is not to present a comprehensive treatment of the book but rather a summary of the major takeaways for me personally.

## About the Author

Crisis of Faith, Scientific Search, Electrical Engineer as Outsider

> So I made a daring, perilous, frightening decision.

> *I was going to let science and engineering answer this question for me*.
>
> I promised that if science really told me that not God, no plan, no intentionality was needed for me to have a wonderfully engineered hand at the end of my arm, then I would make a massive, wholesale change in my belief system. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 7 %}

Challenge of looking closely [^decision].

The author argues he is an outsider, able to see new insights in genetics, communication theory, and bioinformatics.

## Summary

From the Introduction:

> In this book, I offer a 2.0 version of evolution, a brand new paradigm for biology. I will show you that scientists create new species in the lab every day, and I'll show you how they do it. I'll also demonstrate that to the extent science can prove anything, science proves design in DNA. In other words, I'll prove that both sides, the Creationists and the Darwinists, are right. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l xxvi %}

is "prove" a little strong?

{% include note.html content="Find a place to discuss provability v evidence? The author does touch on it, but seems a bit contradictory." %}

And from Appendix A:

> Half the thesis of this book is that randomness does not create codes; and that once they exist, randomness can only destroy them. The other half of this thesis is that the origin of life required the creation of codes, and that nonrandom, linguistic adaptations of DNA continue to create codes and thus drive biological evolution. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 282 %}

- Evolution is a documented, scientifically based reality

- Theists and scientists should both be interested in science based exploration of the natural world

- Proponents of Creationism/Intelligent Design are wrong to deny evolution

- Proponents of Random Mutation (Neo-Darwinists) are wrong to deny designed, goal-driven evolution

- DNA is code (meets the requirements of code, encoder, and decoder)

- Neo-Darwinism is Random Mutation + Natural Selection + Time = Evolution

Use of term Darwinism (with Neo-Darwinism)

- In reality, Adaptive Variation + Natural Selection + Time = Evolution 2.0

## Mechanisms of Evolution

The author spends a good deal of the book describing the known mechanisms of evolution. The strongest argument the author makes is for the reality of evolution based on several hundred years of scientific investigation. "If we rank these \[mechanisms\] from most gradual to most sudden, the list looks like this" {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 144 %}:

*Transposition* -  cells rearranging their own DNA

*Epigenetics* - organisms passing acquired traits to offspring through cells switching DNA sequences on and off

*Horizontal Transfer* - cells exchanging DNA

*Genome Duplication* - two species merging to form a third

{% include note.html content="??? Genome Dupl v Gene Dupl v Whole Genome Dupl v Hybridization" %}

*Symbiogenesis* - organisms merging together to form a brand new organism

some randomness is involved, but it is not the driving force.
 but coupled with a fixation on randomness as the key component driving evolution, due to a desire to show the lack of supernatural involvement. But we see that it isn't random at all, rather it is goal driven and designed.

For me, the most eye-opening revelation in this book is the extent to which

Though obsesively focused on refuting "Darwinism". Neo-Darwinism, etc.

## Evolution is driven by Design

### Other Supernatural references

As this book is intended to be a science book, about what we can discover in our natural world, it does not cover the supernatural in any great extent. But it is important to note that the author does retain his religious belief and gives a node to the supernatural.

> Spirituality is the thing that distinguishes us from animals. It doesn't come from our bodies, it comes from our spirits. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 19 %}
>
> Man is a spiritual being, the first creature made in God's image. Unlike the animals, man is both body and spirit. This is why the origin of man's body plan, which is adapted from lower animals, doesn't alter his spirit identity as a child of God. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 315 %}

## The Commercial Angle

Contradiction between religous and commercial interests. The author posits that we don't know of any naturally occurring codes.  This points to there being a designer of the code, which supports his religious belief. But then he says that such a naturally occurring code would be a commercial bonanza (eg, for engineering and artificial intelligence) so he is willing to back any such a discovery with his own money.

What are his motivations?

- gather further business?
- actually discover naturally occurring codes?
- demonstrate that it's not possible because no one is following the money?

## On Proof and Evidence

> In order to become an atheist, what would have to be true?
>
> - I would need proof that random mutations (...) filtered by natural selection really could generate all manner of elaborate structures like eye and ears. ...
> - I would need to discover a principle--aÂ  law in math, science, or engineering--that said, "X percent of the time, random mutations are neutral. Y percent of the time, they're harmful. Z percent of the time, they do turn out to be helpful." This would have to have been rigorously tested.
> - I would need proof, with bona fide laboratory experiments, that all things really needed to evolve was time and chance.
>
> And one last thing:
>
> - Someone would have to show that the first cells and life itself could emerge from the early ocean without any kind of action by an intelligent agent.
>

Why do the first three require proof while the fourth only need to show possibility?

Isn't proof a much higher burden than he applies to his own faith?

## Conclusions

{% include note.html content="Do I want a Conclusions section, or just include them throughout the post?" %}

The author has a strong bias towards justifying his theism

Many atheists (and educators?) have a strong bias towards justifying their beliefs and therefore firmly hold to the obsolete theory of evolution which hold that all change occurs by undirected "random" changes in the genetic code.

### Origins of life

> Before life can reproduce and before evolution has any chance of occurring, there must first be a code. Currently we have no evidence to suggest that the genetic code, or any code, can come into existence without intelligence. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l xxvi %}

author fails here by a "God of the Gaps"

[^decision]:

    Continuing, the author says:

    > I promised that if science really told me that no God, no plan, no intentionality was needed for me to have a wonderfully engineered hand at the end of my arm, then I would a massive, wholesale change in my belief system.
    >
    > I thought about how my family life could change.
    >
    > My wife might wake up one day to find an atheist sleeping in her bed. I could end up staying home while she took my kids to church. Would I have to bite my lip, or would I try to enlighten all my friends and family that their beliefs are based on fantasy? Would Thanksgiving dinner turn into a brawl over science and religion with my devoutly faithful relatives? I might lose lifelong friends over this.

    I can certainly relate to this dilemma.
