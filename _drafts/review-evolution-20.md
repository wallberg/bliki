In this post I present a summary of my understanding and takeaways from the book Evolution 2.0: Breaking the Deadlock Between Darwin and Design {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 %} The author, Perry Marshall, presents a view of evolution as a middle ground between the dogmatic views of  advocates on two sides. Advocates for Intelligent Design (ID) need to accept that evolution is real, advocates for Neo-Darwinism need to accept that evolution is not random, but goal-driven and designed.

## Summary

From the Introduction:

> In this book, I offer a 2.0 version of evolution, a brand new paradigm for biology. I will show you that scientists create new species in the lab every day, and I'll show you how they do it. I'll also demonstrate that to the extent science can prove anything, science proves design in DNA. In other words, I'll prove that both sides, the Creationists and the Darwinists, are right. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l xxvi %}

{% include note.html content="prove? Find a place to discuss provability v evidence; The author does touch on it, but seems a bit contradictory." %}

And from Appendix A:

> Half the thesis of this book is that randomness does not create codes; and that once they exist, randomness can only destroy them. The other half of this thesis is that the origin of life required the creation of codes, and that nonrandom, linguistic adaptations of DNA continue to create codes and thus drive biological evolution. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 282 %}

My bullet point summary is:

- Evolution by natural selection is a documented and evidence based reality

- DNA is code; it meets all the requirements for being code, it is the main driver of evolution, and it must have been designed

- Dogmatic adherence to ideology impacts both sides of the debate. Proponents of Creationism/ID are right to believe that life is designed by a designer outside of this natural world, but wrong to deny evolution as a threat to their beliefs. Proponents of Random Mutation (Atheism?) are right to believe in evolution, but wrong to deny designed, goal-driven evolution as a threat to their beliefs

- Evolution:
  - according to Darwin: Gradual Variation + Natural Selection + Time
  - according to Neo-Darwinism: Random Mutation + Natural Selection + Time
  - according to current science (Evolution 2.0): Adaptive Variation + Natural Selection + Time

{% include note.html content="(Theism v Atheism) v {Random v Adaptive Evolution" %}

There are two classes of arguments that author makes which I tend to omit here:

- Arguments targeted at theists to convince them that evolution is real

- Ad hominem arguments based on what some particular athiest, theist, or scientist believes or how kind of arguments they make in debates

## Background

Crisis of Faith, Scientific Search, Electrical Engineer as Outsider

Challenge of looking closely [^decision].

The author argues he is an outsider, able to see new insights in genetics, communication theory, and bioinformatics.

## Mechanisms of Evolution

The author spends a good deal of the book describing the known mechanisms of evolution. The strongest argument he makes is for the reality of evolution based on several hundred years of scientific investigation. The supporting evidence comes from the fossil record, the form and function of living things today, and on the ever increasing amount of DNA evidence.

### Darwinism

> The term *Darwinism* formally refers to the theory of evolution as Charles Darwin expressed it in *On the Origin of Species* in 1859. He postulated that small variations in organisms over vast periods of time, filtered by natural selection, were responsible for the development of new species. Darwin's original theory might be summarized like this:
>
> Gradual Variation + Natural Selection + Time = Evolution {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 37 %}

The author presented several examples of descent with modification, or common ancenstry, which started his exploration into evolution:

- [Whales in the past had feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeoceti); modern whales are descendents of those ancestors and [some retain vestiges of legs and feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale#Locomotion), "disconnected from the rest of its skeleton and suspended in the flesh".

- [Blind mole rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spalax) have fully formed eyes which are completely covered by skin, an adaptation for their life underground. They have eyes because they descended from animals which used those eyes.

- Humans are primates because they contain common [pseudogenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudogene) (nonfunctional segments of DNA) found nowhere else in the animal kingdom. Why would someone independently designing these species introduce the same nonfunctioning DNA code into both of them and nowhere else? Not proof of common ancestry, but strong evidence.

> As I continued to research this, it became clear to me that evolution most definitely appeared to have happened. *But How?* I started hunting through a pile of research from the 1950s to today. I resolved to find some kind of mechanism that would explain it all. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 20 %}

### Information Theory

The author argues that DNA is a code, just as in traditional information theory as layed out by Claude Shannon, [involving transmission, processing, extraction, and utilization of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory):

- The code is written in the alphabet of DNA nucleotides (A, C, G, or T)

- The alphabet is used to create words composed of three nucleotides, called codons

- Each codon is an instruction to build one amino acid from specific elements

- Genes are sequences of codons which specify assemblies of proteins

- "Combinations of genes form an interdependent complex of instructions and a matrix of code elements, packed into chromosomes {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 45 %}

> DNA, like many human-made codes, also has reduncancy, error correction, checksums, linguistic structure, and codes layered inside of codes {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 39 %}.

### Randomness

Nevertheless the author makes a good case that random mutation is neither the only nor even the primary mechanism of evolutionary change. Mutations do occur, but most random mutations would only 

> Darwin himself didn't strongly evangelize his belief that the variations, or the mutations, were random. Randomness didn't become dogma until the 20th century. Darwin didn't know where the variations came from. He didn't know about genetics and he didn't know anything about cells or DNA. \[...] For simplicity, in this book I will normally refer to Neo-Darwinism and the Modern Synthesis as Darwinism. Here, the use of Darwinism emphasizes assumptions of randomness. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 37 %}.

I found the author's practice of "normally", but not always, referring to *Neo-Darwinism* as *Darwinism* to be confusing, because it became difficult to distinguish when he is referring to *random mutation* versus *natural selection*. In addition, the term *Neo-Darwinism* itself may not be as strongly tied to randomness as the author suggests [^neodarwinism].




### Adaptive Variation

"If we rank these \[mechanisms] from most gradual to most sudden, the list looks like this" {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 144 %}:

*Transposition* - cells rearranging their own DNA

*Epigenetics* - organisms passing acquired traits to offspring through cells switching DNA sequences on and off

*Horizontal Transfer* - cells exchanging DNA

*Genome Duplication* - two species merging to form a third

{% include note.html content="??? Genome Dupl v Gene Dupl v Whole Genome Dupl v Hybridization" %}

*Symbiogenesis* - organisms merging together to form a brand new organism


### Design

### Other Supernatural references

As this book is intended to be a science book, about what we can discover in our natural world, it does not cover the supernatural in any great extent. But it is important to note that the author does retain his religious belief and gives a node to the supernatural.

> Spirituality is the thing that distinguishes us from animals. It doesn't come from our bodies, it comes from our spirits. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 19 %}
>
> Man is a spiritual being, the first creature made in God's image. Unlike the animals, man is both body and spirit. This is why the origin of man's body plan, which is adapted from lower animals, doesn't alter his spirit identity as a child of God. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 315 %}

{% include note.html content="Quote 'proof of supernaturl' here" %}

## The Commercial Angle

Contradiction between religous and commercial interests. The author posits that we don't know of any naturally occurring codes.  This points to there being a designer of the code, which supports his religious belief. But then he says that such a naturally occurring code would be a commercial bonanza (eg, for engineering and artificial intelligence) so he is willing to back any such a discovery with his own money.

What are his motivations?

- gather further business?
- actually discover naturally occurring codes?
- demonstrate that it's not possible because no one is following the money?

## On Proof and Evidence

> In order to become an atheist, what would have to be true?
>
> - I would need proof that random mutations (...) filtered by natural selection really could generate all manner of elaborate structures like eye and ears. ...
> - I would need to discover a principle--a  law in math, science, or engineering--that said, "X percent of the time, random mutations are neutral. Y percent of the time, they're harmful. Z percent of the time, they do turn out to be helpful." This would have to have been rigorously tested.
> - I would need proof, with bona fide laboratory experiments, that all things really needed to evolve was time and chance.
>
> And one last thing:
>
> - Someone would have to show that the first cells and life itself could emerge from the early ocean without any kind of action by an intelligent agent.

Why do the first three require proof while the fourth only need to show possibility?

Isn't proof a much higher burden than he applies to his own faith?

## Weaknesses

On debate: Being dogmatic or argumentative are traits that people have, regardless of their ideology.  If you go to online forums, you are going to get dogma and arguments.

## Conclusions

{% include note.html content="Do I want a Conclusions section, or just include them throughout the post?" %}

The author has a strong bias towards justifying his theism

Many atheists (and educators?) have a strong bias towards justifying their beliefs and therefore firmly hold to the obsolete theory of evolution which hold that all change occurs by undirected "random" changes in the genetic code.

Is "Neo-Darwinism the prevailing paradigm in science today"?

Is Evolution 2.0 a "brand new paradigm for biology" ?

Does "science prove design in DNA"?

### Information Theory and Evolution

### Origins of life

> Before life can reproduce and before evolution has any chance of occurring, there must first be a code. Currently we have no evidence to suggest that the genetic code, or any code, can come into existence without intelligence. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l xxvi %}

author fails here by a "God of the Gaps"

## Footnotes

[^neodarwinism]:

    > Neo-Darwinism is generally used to describe any integration of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection with Gregor Mendel's theory of genetics. It mostly refers to evolutionary theory from either 1895 (for the combinations of Darwin's and August Weismann's theories of evolution) or 1942 ("modern synthesis"), but it can mean any new Darwinian- and Mendelian-based theory, such as the current evolutionary theory. The term "Neo-Darwinism" marks the combination of natural selection and genetics, as has been variously modified since it was first proposed.

    Continuing, the author says:

    > I promised that if science really told me that no God, no plan, no intentionality was needed for me to have a wonderfully engineered hand at the end of my arm, then I would make a massive, wholesale change in my belief system.
    >
    > I thought about how my family life could change.
    >
    > My wife might wake up one day to find an atheist sleeping in her bed. I could end up staying home while she took my kids to church. Would I have to bite my lip, or would I try to enlighten all my friends and family that their beliefs are based on fantasy? Would Thanksgiving dinner turn into a brawl over science and religion with my devoutly faithful relatives? I might lose lifelong friends over this.

    I can certainly relate to this dilemma.
