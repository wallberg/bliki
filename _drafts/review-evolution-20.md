In this post I present a summary of my understanding and takeaways from the book Evolution 2.0: Breaking the Deadlock Between Darwin and Design {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 %} The author, Perry Marshall, presents a view of evolution as a middle ground between the dogmatic views of advocates on two sides. Advocates for Intelligent Design (ID) need to accept that evolution is real, advocates for Neo-Darwinism need to accept that evolution is not random, but goal-driven and designed.

## Summary

From the Introduction:

> In this book, I offer a 2.0 version of evolution, a brand new paradigm for biology. I will show you that scientists create new species in the lab every day, and I'll show you how they do it. I'll also demonstrate that to the extent science can prove anything, science proves design in DNA. In other words, I'll prove that both sides, the Creationists and the Darwinists, are right. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l xxvi %}

And from Appendix A:

> Half the thesis of this book is that randomness does not create codes; and that once they exist, randomness can only destroy them. The other half of this thesis is that the origin of life required the creation of codes, and that nonrandom, linguistic adaptations of DNA continue to create codes and thus drive biological evolution. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 282 %}

My bullet point summary is:

- Evolution by natural selection is a documented and evidence based reality

- DNA is code; it meets all the requirements for being code, it is the main driver of evolution, and it must have been designed

- Dogmatic adherence to ideology impacts both sides of the debate. Proponents of Creationism/ID are right to believe that life is designed by a designer outside of this natural world, but wrong to deny evolution as a threat to their beliefs. Proponents of Random Mutation (Atheism?) are right to believe in evolution, but wrong to deny designed, goal-driven evolution as a threat to their beliefs

- Evolution:
  - according to Darwin: Gradual Variation + Natural Selection + Time
  - according to Neo-Darwinism[^neodarwinism]: Random Mutation + Natural Selection + Time
  - according to current science (Evolution 2.0): Adaptive Variation + Natural Selection + Time

{% include note.html content="consider removing below" %}

There are two classes of arguments that author makes which I tend to omit here:

- Arguments targeted at theists to convince them that evolution is real

- Ad hominem arguments based on what some particular athiest, theist, or scientist believes or how kind of arguments they make in debates

## Background

Perry Marshall is an electrical engineer by training and has worked in digital communications, control systems, acoustics, and e-commerce. A conversation with his brother about the age of the earth and the possibility of evolution challenged his faith and his assumptions. He felt he could no longer ignore the scientific findings concerning evolution, yet as an engineer he could not fathom the mechanism of evolution as random.

> So I made a daring, perilous, frightening decision.
>
> *I was going to let science and engineering answer this question for me*.
>
> I promised that if science really told me that not God, no plan, no intentionality was needed for me to have a wonderfully engineered hand at the end of my arm, then I would make a massive, wholesale change in my belief system.[^decision] {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 7 %}

The author embarked on ten years of research into the the latest scientific understanding of evolution. As a result he presents a new Evolution 2.0 view of evolotuion and biology, and argues that as an outsider he is able to see bring insights in genetics, communication theory, and bioinformatics.

## Mechanisms of Evolution

The author spends a good deal of the book describing the known mechanisms of evolution. The strongest argument he makes is for the reality of evolution based on several hundred years of scientific investigation. The supporting evidence comes from the fossil record, the form and function of living beings today, and on the ever increasing amount of DNA evidence.

### Darwinism

> The term *Darwinism* formally refers to the theory of evolution as Charles Darwin expressed it in *On the Origin of Species* in 1859. He postulated that small variations in organisms over vast periods of time, filtered by natural selection, were responsible for the development of new species. Darwin's original theory might be summarized like this:
>
> Gradual Variation + Natural Selection + Time = Evolution {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 37 %}

The author presented several examples of descent with modification, or common ancenstry, which started his exploration into evolution:

- [Whales in the past had feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeoceti); modern whales are descendents of those ancestors and [some retain vestiges of legs and feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale#Locomotion), "disconnected from the rest of its skeleton and suspended in the flesh".

- [Blind mole rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spalax) have fully formed eyes which are completely covered by skin, an adaptation for their life underground. They have eyes because they descended from animals which used those eyes.

- Humans are primates because they contain common [pseudogenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudogene) (nonfunctional segments of DNA) found nowhere else in the animal kingdom. Why would someone independently designing these species introduce the same nonfunctioning DNA code into both of them and nowhere else? Not proof of common ancestry, but strong evidence.

> As I continued to research this, it became clear to me that evolution most definitely appeared to have happened. *But How?* I started hunting through a pile of research from the 1950s to today. I resolved to find some kind of mechanism that would explain it all. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 20 %}

### Information Theory

The author argues that DNA is a code, just as in traditional information theory as layed out by Claude Shannon, [involving transmission, processing, extraction, and utilization of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory):

- The code is written in the alphabet of DNA nucleotides (A, C, G, or T)

- This alphabet is used to create words composed of three nucleotides, called codons

- Each codon is an instruction to build one amino acid from specific elements

- Genes are sequences of codons which specify assemblies of proteins

> Information organization in DNA is the same as digital data. \[...] Combinations of genes form an interdependent complex of instructions and a matrix of code elements, packed into chromosomes. \[...] and just like digital data, the information in DNA is fragile. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 45 %}
>
> DNA, like many human-made codes, also has reduncancy, error correction, checksums, linguistic structure, and codes layered inside of codes {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 39 %}.

But are they the same? Digital layers are intentionally isolated from each other.Â  DNA and biological systems have messy interdependences and feedback loops, everything is tangled. People design digital systems to reduce complexity so that we can understand them. Do our formal systems of mathematics and information theory and discrete digital systems accurately model DNA and biological systems?

### Randomness

> Darwin himself didn't strongly evangelize his belief that the variations, or the mutations, were random. Randomness didn't become dogma until the 20th century. Darwin didn't know where the variations came from. He didn't know about genetics and he didn't know anything about cells or DNA.[^neodarwinism] {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 36 %}

The author makes a good case that random mutation is neither the only nor even the primary mechanism of evolutionary change. Mutations do occasionally occur which would be beneficial, but most random mutations only cause failures in the biological systems, ie create "noise" in the "information channel" which would render the message unusable.

> *Random* means when a system changes, it follow no particular pattern. *Deterministic* means that given two identical situations, the system will do the exact same thing each time because it's utterly predictable. But when cells change their DNA, their response is neither random nor deterministic. It's actually somehwere in between. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 302 %}

It's ergodic, which means that as DNA changes there is some randomness (ie, what is the resulting change in function or how well does the change aid in survival given the current environment \[selection]), but the goal-seeking design of DNA means that there are also patterns that emerge.

### Adaptive Variation

The author presents a wide range of scientific findings about how DNA, and the cells that host and maintain that DNA, have a goal-oriented design: they work to keep themselves alive and to reproduce.

"If we rank these \[mechanisms] from most gradual to most sudden, the list looks like this" {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 144 %}:

*Transposition* - cells rearranging their own DNA

*Epigenetics* - organisms passing acquired traits to offspring through cells switching DNA sequences on and off

*Horizontal Transfer* - cells exchanging DNA

*Genome Duplication / Hybridization* - two species merging to form a third

*Symbiogenesis* - organisms merging together to form a brand new organism

With just a little cross referencing, I found these descriptions of adaptive variation to be scientifically credible.

### Design and the Supernatural

> Before life can reproduce and before evolution has any chance of occurring, there must first be a code. Currently we have no evidence to suggest that the genetic code, or any code, can come into existence without intelligence. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l xxvi %}

author fails here by a "God of the Gaps"

> Spirituality is the thing that distinguishes us from animals. It doesn't come from our bodies, it comes from our spirits. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 19 %}
>
> Man is a spiritual being, the first creature made in God's image. Unlike the animals, man is both body and spirit. This is why the origin of man's body plan, which is adapted from lower animals, doesn't alter his spirit identity as a child of God. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 315 %}

We know from scientific study that life has existed on earth for about 3.6-3.9 billion years. Bacteria reigned alone for half of this time, then came came life with more complex, nucleated cells, then animals, fungi, and plants arrived for the final 15 percent of that time. According to the author, the origin of life is a designer who created the first cell with DNA code then set it loose to evolve via natural processes, driven by its goal-seeking design, for billions of years. Then at some point in the last 200,000 years or so the designer returned and attached a spirit to homo sapiens and we became both body and spirit.

I suppose it's possible, but it's not clear to me why an omnipotent and omniscient designer would follow this particular route.

> In my personal experience, religious faith is a based on evidence, past experience, history, and reason. \[...] *experience* includes things like documented healings, answered prayers, and extraordinary sequences of events far too remarkable to ascribe to chance.[^faith] {%cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 218 %}

I'm not aware of any this evidence, documented scientifically or in *my* personal experience. I think the author is simply motivated to justify his faith and ignore his basic statistics.

## The Commercial Angle

Contradiction between religous and commercial interests. The author posits that we don't know of any naturally occurring codes.  This points to there being a designer of the code, which supports his religious belief. But then he says that such a naturally occurring code would be a commercial bonanza (eg, for engineering and artificial intelligence) so he is willing to back any such a discovery with his own money.

Commercial website

What are his motivations?

- gather further business?
- actually discover naturally occurring codes?
- demonstrate that it's not possible because no one is following the money?

## Further Study

Here are some topics I would like to explore further, based on reading this book:

- How well does information theory, a formal system, really model the messy world of organic life? Does science prove design in DNA?

- The mechanisms of evolution.

- What is the latest scientific research available on the origins of life?

- To what extent is randomness still dogma in science and education?

- The nature of evidence and provability in science and faith.

And these are on my list of books to read:

- Acquiring Genomes: A Theory of the Origins of Species {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 %}

- Information Theory, Evolution, and the Origin of Life {% cite yockeyInformationTheoryEvolution2005 %}

- The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief {% cite collinsLanguageGodScientist2006 %}

- Origins of Life {% cite dysonOriginsLife1999 %}

Would Thanksgiving dinner turn into a brawl over science and religion with my devoutly faithful relatives? I might lose lifelong friends over this.

    I can certainly relate to this dilemma.

[^neodarwinism]:

    On Neo-Darwinism:

    > Darwin himself didn't strongly evangelize his belief that the variations, or the mutations, were random. Randomness didn't become dogma until the 20th century. Darwin didn't know where the variations came from. He didn't know about genetics and he didn't know anything about cells or DNA. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 36 %}

    > For simplicity, in this book I will normally refer to Neo-Darwinism and the Modern Synthesis as Darwinism. Here, the use of Darwinism emphasizes assumptions of randomness. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 37 %}

    I found the author's practice of "normally", but not always, referring to *Neo-Darwinism* as *Darwinism* to be confusing, because it became difficult to distinguish when he is referring to *random mutation* versus *natural selection*. In addition, the term *Neo-Darwinism* itself may not be as strongly tied to randomness as the author suggests.

    > Neo-Darwinism is generally used to describe any integration of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection with Gregor Mendel's theory of genetics. It mostly refers to evolutionary theory from either 1895 (for the combinations of Darwin's and August Weismann's theories of evolution) or 1942 ("modern synthesis"), but it can mean any new Darwinian- and Mendelian-based theory, such as the current evolutionary theory. The term "Neo-Darwinism" marks the combination of natural selection and genetics, as has been variously modified since it was first proposed.
