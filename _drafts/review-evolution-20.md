In this post I review Evolution 2.0: Breaking the Deadlock Between Darwin and Design {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 %} The author, Perry Marshall, presents a view of evolution as a middle ground between the dogmatic views of many advocates of two sides. Advocates for Intelligent Design need to accept that evolution is real, advocates for Neo-Darwinism need to accept that evolution is not random or designless. My intent here is not to present a comprehensive treatment of the book but rather a summary of the major takeaways for me personally.

Challenge of looking closely [^decision].

## Summary

From the Introduction:

> In this book, I offer a 2.0 version of evolution, a brand new paradigm for biology. I will show you that scientists create new species in the lab every day, and I'll show you how they do it. I'll also demonstrate that to the extent science can prove anything, science proves design in DNA. In other words, I'll prove that both sides, the Creationists and the Darwinists, are right. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l xxvi %}

And from Appendix A:

> Half the thesis of this book is that randomness does not create codes; and that once they exist, randomness can only destroy them. The other half of this thesis is that the origin of life required the creation of codes, and that nonrandom, linguistic adaptations of DNA continue to create codes and thus drive biological evolution. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l 282 %}

- Evolution is a documented, scientifically based reality

- Theists and scientists should both be interested in science based exploration of the natural world

- Proponents of Creationism/Intelligent Design are wrong to deny evolution

- Proponents of Random Mutation (Neo-Darwinists) are wrong to deny designed, goal-driven evolution

- DNA is code (meets the requirements of code, encoder, and decoder)

- Neo-Darwinism is Random Mutation + Natural Selection + Time = Evolution

Use of term Darwinism (with Neo-Darwinism)

- In reality, Adaptive Variation + Natural Selection + Time = Evolution 2.0

## Evolution is not Random

I feel the strongest argument the author makes in this book is for the reality of evolution based on several hundred years of scientific investigation, but coupled with a bizarre fixation on randomness as the key component driving evolution, when in fact we see that

For me, the most eye-opening revelation in this book is the extent to which

Though obsesively focused on

## Evolution is driven by Design

## Conclusions

The author has a strong bias towards justifying his theism

Many atheists (and educators?) have a strong bias towards justifying their beliefs and therefore firmly hold to the obsolete theory of evolution which hold that all change occurs by undirected "random" changes in the genetic code.

## Further Study

### Presentation of Evolutionary Theory

### Information Theory and Evolution

### Origins of life

> Before life can reproduce and before evolution has any chance of occurring, there must first be a code. Currently we have no evidence to suggest that the genetic code, or any code, can come into existence without intelligence. {% cite marshallEvolutionBreakingDeadlock2015 -l xxvi %}

author fails here by a "God of the Gaps"

    Continuing, the author says:

    > I promised that if science really told me that no God, no plan, no intentionality was needed for me to have a wonderfully engineered hand at the end of my arm, then I would a massive, wholesale change in my belief system.
    >
    > I thought about how my family life could change.
    >
    > My wife might wake up one day to find an atheist sleeping in her bed. I could end up staying home while she took my kids to church. Would I have to bite my lip, or would I try to enlighten all my friends and family that their beliefs are based on fantasy? Would Thanksgiving dinner turn into a brawl over science and religion with my devoutly faithful relatives? I might lose lifelong friends over this.

    I can certainly relate to this dilemma.
