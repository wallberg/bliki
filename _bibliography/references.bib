Amino acids are biologically important organic compounds containing amine (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, along with a side-chain (R group) specific to each amino acid.[1][2][3] The key elements of an amino acid are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, though other elements are found in the side-chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and can be classified in many ways.
Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate, or catalyze, chemical reactions. The molecules at the beginning of the process upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. The set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell.
Most enzymes are proteins, although a few are catalytic RNA molecules. Enzymes' specificity comes from their unique three-dimensional structures.
Indirect Development (p. 46) "the system by which an embryo sets aside a package of cells that are destined to grow into an adult, the body plan of the adult having no connection with the body plan of the embryo. The advantage of this system is that the embryo provides life support to the adult during the vulnerable stages of its early growth, whereas the adult is free to evolve elaborate and fine-tuned structures unconstrained by existing structures of the embryo."
Metabolism is the set of life-sustaining chemical transformations within the cells of living organisms. The three main purposes of metabolism are the conversion of food/fuel to energy to run cellular processes, the conversion of food/fuel to building blocks for proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and some carbohydrates, and the elimination of nitrogenous wastes. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word metabolism can also refer to the sum of all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms, including digestion and the transport of substances into and between different cells, in which case the set of reactions within the cells is called intermediary metabolism or intermediate metabolism.
Molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term molecule is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions.
Nucleic acids are biopolymers, or large biomolecules, essential for all known forms of life. Nucleic acids, which include DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid), are made from monomers known as nucleotides. Each nucleotide has three components: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. If the sugar is deoxyribose, the polymer is DNA. If the sugar is ribose, the polymer is RNA. When all three components are combined, they form a nucleotide. Nucleotides are also known as phosphate nucleotides.
Proteins are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity.
Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism.

Reducing Atmosphere is an atmospheric condition in which oxidation is prevented by removal of oxygen and other oxidizing gases or vapours, and which may contain actively reducing gases such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and gases such as hydrogen sulfide that would be oxidized by any present oxygen.

recommended as "a fine piece of English prose", not too technical, highly influential},
	annote = {p. 6 Reproduction v Replication

I am suggesting as a hypothesis that the earliest living creatures were able to reproduce but not to replicate.

Cells can reproduce: divide into two cells with the daughter cells inheriting approx. equal share of the cellular constituents.
Only molecules can replicate: construct a precise copy of itself by a specific chemical process

In modern times, reproduction of cells is always accompanied by the replication of molecules, but this need not always have been so in the past.

General Stoffwechsel, "stuff change", with no restriction to genetically directed process.

hardware is mainly protein and software is mainly nucleic acid.  Protein is the essential component for metabolism.  Nucleic acid is the essential component for replication. ... For a complete self-reproducing automaton, both components are essential.

hardware without software can exist and maintain its own metabolism.  software without hardware must exist as a parasite.

To summarize, Eigen made RNA using an enzyme but no template, and Orgel made RNA using a template but no enzyme. In living cells, RNA is made using both templates and enzymes.  If we suppose that RNA was the original molecule with which life began, then to understand the origin of life we need to make RNA with neither a template nor an enzyme.},
	annote = {p. 13 The RNA World
The phrase "The RNA World" was introduced to describe the state of affairs in early times when RNA-life was evolving without the help of protein enzymes.
...
I do not consider the existence of ribozymes to be a decisive reason to believe in the existence of an RNA world.},
	annote = {p. 14 symbiogenesis
[Lynn Margulis] built a bridge between the fact of cellular anatomy and the symbiosis of molecular genetics. Her bridge was the idea that parasitism and symbiosis were the driving forces in the evolution of cellular complexity.
...
The erstwhile disease organism became by degrees a chronic parasite, a symbiotic partner, and finally an indispensable part of the substance of the host. This Margulis picture of early cellular evolution now has incontrovertible experimental support.  The molecular structures of chloroplasts and mitochondria are found to be related more closely to alien bacteria than to the cells in which they have been incorporated for one or two billion years.
[BW] Have we really found alien bacteria as in extra-Earth origin?
 },
	annote = {p. 19 neutral theory of evolution
The neutral theory says that, through the history of life from beginning to end, random statistical fluctuations have been more important than Darwinian selection in causing species to evolve.  Evolution by random statistical fluctuation is called genetic drift.
In particular, I find it reasonable to suppose that genetic drift was dominant in the very earliest phase of biological evolution before the mechanisms of heredity had become established.Even if the neutral theory is not true in general, it may be a useful approximation to make in building models of prebiotic evolution.},
	annote = {p. 22 study of prebiotic evolution: geophysical, chemical, biological
geophysical stage - early history of the earth and especially with the nature of the earth's primitive crust, ocean, and atmosphere
chemical stage - synthesis, by natural processes operating within plausible models of the primitive atmosphere and ocean, of the chemical building blocks of life
biological stage - appearance of biological organization, with the building of a coordinated population of large molecules with catalytic functions out of a random assortment of building blocks
"The problem of the origin of life is for me the biological stage, the problem of the appearance of biological organization out of molecular chaos."},
	annote = {p. 23 chemistry, amino acids and nucleotides
"The results are always consistent.  The input of energy into a reducing atmosphere cause production of amino acids in substantial quantity.  The input of energy into a neutral or oxidizing atmosphere does not."
"The prebiotic synthesis of nucleotides is a more difficult problem. Efforts to synthesize nucleotides directly from their elementary components in a Miller-style experiment have not been successful."
p. 26 "A single-origin hypothesis requires amino acids and nucleotides to be synthesized by natural processes before life began. The double-origin hypothesis requires only amino acids to be synthesized prebiotically, the nucleotides being formed later as a by-product of protein metabolism.  The evidence from chemical simulations does not disprove the single-origin hypothesis but makes a strong presumptive case against it."
 
 
 },
	annote = {p. 26 Genetics and Paleontology
"The main fact that we have learned from genetics is that the genetic apparatus is universal. By the genetic apparatus I mean the organization of ribosomes and transfer RNA molecules that enables a cell to translate a nucleic acid gene into a protein according to the triplet code. In modern cells the gene is transcribed into a molecule of messenger RNA before being translated. The forms of messenger RNA are highly variable from species to species. The triplet code is embodied in the transfer RNA molecules and is the same in all cells apart from minor differences. This universality of the genetic apparatus is strong evidence that all existing cells are descended from a common ancestor. There must have been a unique latest common ancestor, a single cell whose progeny diversified into the myriad branches of the evolutionary tree. We know from the genetic evidence that the latest common ancestor already possessed an essentially complete genetic apparatus with the same triplet code used in modern cells.},
	annote = {p. 28 Origin of viruses
viruses reproduce only within cells and borrow the genetic apparatus of the cells they invade
"A virus may be nothing more than a plasmid that has learned to survive outside its host cell by covering itself with a protein coat. Alternatively, a virus may be a highly degenerate descendant of a normal cell that has adopted a parasitic mode of life and lost all of its metabolic functions. The origin of viruses is still an open question.  All that we can say for sure is that, because viruses as they now exist are totally parasitic, there must have been cells before there were viruses."

	annote = {p. 30 Microfossils and their age
"The results of a great number of observations of micorfossils can be briefly summarized as follows.  I use the word eon to mean a billion years. In rocks that are reliably dated with age about 3 eons ... we find microfossils that resemble modern bacteria in shape and size. In rocks dated with age about 2 eons ... we find fossils that resemble modern procaryotic algae, including chains  of cells and other multicellular structures. In rocks datd with age about 1 eon ... we find fossils that resemble modern eucaryotic cells with some traces of internal structure. The fossils are too small to be analyzed chemically with any accuracy, but traces of long-chain hydrocarbons have been found in the 3-eon group, whereas the 1-eon group contains porphyrin reidues that are presumably derived from chlorophyll.
"The geological dating of the various fossil groups is remarkably accurate and reliable. Unfortunately, we do not know with equal accuracy what it is being dated."
 },
	annote = {p. 33 Reducing Atmosphere
"Two lines of evidence have made it clear that the reducing atomsphere, if it ever existed, had disappeared by the time of heavy meteoric bombardment of the earth ceased about 3.8 eons ago."
"Sedimentary rocks laid down on the ancient earth, including carbonates and various oxidized forms of iron, have been reliably dated with ages going all the way back to 3.8 eons.These rocks could not have formed under reducing conditions. Their composition proves that the atmosphere was neutral from 3.8 until about 2 eons ago, when molecular oxygen first appeared. The atmosphere became oxidizing after life was well established and photosynthetic organisms began to produce free oxygen in large quantities."
"The second line of evidence for an early neutral atmosphere comes from the rarity of the inert gases remaining in the earth's atmosphere today."

	annote = {p. 39 error catastrophe
"The central problem for any theory of the origin of replication is that a replicative apparatus has to function almost perfectly if it is to function at all. If it does not function perfectly, it will give rise to errors in replicating itself, and the errors will accumulate from generation to generation.
p. 40
Nε {\textless} log S     (2.1)
N - number of bits in a self replicating system
ε - probability of error in replicating a single bit
S - selection factor penalty for natural selection
(log S) is the number of bits of information supplied by the selective action of the environment
"The condition (2.1) is very stringent. Because the selective advantage of an error-free system cannot be astronomically large, the logarithm cannot be much greater than unity. To satisfy this condition (2.1) we must have an error rate of the order of N-1 at most. The condition is barely satisfied in modern higher organisms that have N of the order of 108 and ε of the order of 10-8. To achieve an error rate as low as 10-8, modern organisms have evolved an extremely elaborate system of double checking and error correction within the replication system. Before any of this delicate apparatus existed, the error rates must have been much higher. The condition (2.1) thus imposes severe requirements on any theory of the origin of life..."
p. 41
"All the experiments that have been done with RNA replication under abiotic conditions give error rates of the order of 10-2 at best."
"If an RNA world ever existed, it must have lived all the time close to the edge of an error catastrophe."
 },
	annote = {p. 46 Theories (with unification)
"I am suggesting that the Oparin [primary emphasis on metabolism] and Eigen [primary emphasis on replication] theories make more sense if they are put together and interpreted as the two halves of a double-origin theory".
"Roughly speaking, Cairns-Smith equals Oparin plus Eigen plus a little bit of clay. All three theories may turn out to contain essential elements of the truth."
"There is a possible analogy between the origin of life and the origin of elaborate body plans in higher organisms."
 There is evidence that the great majority of existing body plans arose from indirect development. "This fact was overlooked until recently because the two best-known body plans, the chordate and the arthropod, are exceptions to the rule. The chordates and arthropods, the two most successful phyla of animals, probably began like the others with indirect development but later evolved a shortcut system of direct development with the adult body plan growing directly from the embryo."
"If the system of indirect development came first, it means that multi-cellular organisms evolved by a two-step process. The first step was the evolution of embryonic forms of limited complexity lacking the genetic machinery to program specialized structures. The second step was the evolution of adult forms with the modern armamentarium of genetic controls and with life support provided by the embryo. I am proposing that the early evolution of life followed the same two-step pattern as the evolution of higher organisms. First came the embryonic stage of life, cells with functioning metabolism but without any genetic apparatus, unable to evolve beyond a primitive level. Second came the adult stage, cells with genetic machinery allowing the evolution of far more finely tuned metabolic pathways and again with life support provided by the first stage while the second stage evolved.
To me, one of the most attractive features of the two-stage theory of the origin of life is that it shows life following the same pattern at three crucial periods of its history: first, the period of origins, when the two stages were metabolism and replication; second, the evolution of eucaryotic cells according to Margulis, when the two stages were parasitic invasion and symbiosis; and, third, the evolution of higher organisms, when the two stages were the embryo and the package of cells that grew into an adult. In each of the three revolutions, the first stage relied on crude and simple modes of inheritance, and the second stage jumped to new levels of sophistication in the translation of anatomical structure into genetic language."
Origins: metabolism and replication
Eucaryotic Cells: parasitic invasion and symbiosis
Higher Organisms: Embryo and Adult

	annote = {p. 48 Chapter 3:  A Toy Model
In this chapter Dyson describes his attempt to understand the Oparin theory of the origin of life, with its emphasis on metabolism. Eigen was able to formulate a system of equations for his replication focused theory, but that was an easier task given it is easy to precisely define replication.
Dyson reduces the Oparin theory to a mathematically precise form in two stages. "The first stage is a formal description of molecular populations treating them like a classical dynamical system and making the dynamical equations precise but leaving the laws of interaction completely general. ... The second stage consists of the reduction of the general theory to a toy model by the assumption of a simple and arbitrary rule for the probability of molecular interactions."
"The decisive events in a theory of the origin of metabolism are the rare statistical jumps when a molecular population in one quasi-stationary state happens to undergo a succession of chemical reactions that push it up, against the gradient of probability, over a barrier and down into another quasi-stationary state.If the initial state is disorganized and the final state is organized, the jump may be considered to be a model for the origin of metabolism."
 One of the conclusions that Dyson reaches when comparing the results of the model with modern cells is that "for life to originate spontaneously it was essential to have an ordered state with a high error rate, but when life was once established the whole course of evolution was toward more specialized structures with lower tolerance of errors."
 },
	annote = {p. 67 Why do we need disordered states?
"Because life is an ordered state, why should not life have remained for ever in the "Garden of Eden" region where only ordered states exist? The model does not supply an answer to these questions because it only describes random drift of populations without Darwinian selection. So far as the model is concerned, life could have begun and remained permanently frozen in the disordered state. But in fact, Darwinian selection was essential if life was to evolve beyond the primitive stage describe by the model. After the model ends, as soon as the droplets described by the model begin to exhaust the available resources and to compete with one another for survival, Darwinian evolution begins. Darwinian selection requires death, and death is the transition from order to disorder. Life had to invent death to evolve. Droplets frozen in the ordered state could not experiment and diversify. The droplets that stayed in the transition region, constantly dying and being reborn with new combinations of chemicals in new catalytic cycles, had the best chance of adapting fast to changing environments."
